## Summary

Kitura is a web framework and web server that is created for web services written in Swift.

## Features:

- URL routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- URL parameters
- Static file serving
- JSON parsing
- Pluggable middleware

## Installation (Docker development environment)

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) on your development system and start a Docker session/terminal.

2. From the Docker session, pull down the `kitura-ubuntu` image from Docker Hub:

  `docker pull ibmcom/kitura-ubuntu:latest`

3. Create a Docker container using the `kitura-ubuntu` image you just downloaded:

  `docker run -i -t ibmcom/kitura-ubuntu:latest /bin/bash`

4. From within the Docker container, execute the `ci.sh` script to build Kitura and execute the test cases:

  `/root/ci.sh`

  The last output line from executing the `ci.sh` script should be similar to:

  `>> Build and execution of test cases completed (see above for results).`

5. You can now run the KituraSample executable inside the Docker container:

  `/root/Kitura/.build/debug/KituraSample`

  You should see a message that says "Listening on port 8090".

## Installation (Vagrant development environment)

1. Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

2. Download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

3. From the root of the Kitura folder containing the `vagrantfile`, create and configure a guest machine:

 `vagrant up`

4. SSH into the Vagrant machine:

 `vagrant ssh`

5. From the Vagrant shell, run the sample program:

 `Kitura/.build/debug/KituraSample`. You should see a message that says "Listening on port 8090".

6. As needed for development, edit the `vagrantfile` to setup [Synced Folders](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/basic_usage.html) to share files between your host and guest machine.

## Installation (OS X)

1. Clone this repository:

 `git clone https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura`

2. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

 `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

 `brew install http-parser pcre2 curl hiredis`

4. Download and install the latest Swift compiler.

 Make sure the latest Swift compiler is installed https://swift.org/download/. After installing it, make sure you update your PATH environment variable as described in the installation instructions (e.g. export PATH=/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest.xctoolchain/usr/bin:$PATH)

5. Build Kitura and Kitura Sample

 Run `make` to build the helper libraries, Kitura framework, and the sample program (invokes swift build).

6. Run KituraSample:

 You can run the sample program which located in: `<path-to-repo>/.build/debug`. From the project root, execute the `./.build/debug/KituraSample` command from a terminal window. You should see a message that says "Listening on port 8090".

## Installation (Linux)

1. Install the following system linux libraries:

 `sudo apt-get install libhttp-parser-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libhiredis-dev`

2. Install the latest [Swift compiler for Linux](https://swift.org/download/).

 Follow the instructions provided on that page. After installing it (i.e. uncompressing the tar file), make sure you update your PATH environment variable so that it includes the extracted tools: `export PATH=/<path to uncompress tar contents>/usr/bin:$PATH`. To update the PATH env variable, you can update your .bashrc file (for further information on .bashrc and .bash_profile see http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2005/07/bash_profile_vs.html).

3. Clone the libdispatch library:

 `git clone https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch.git`

4. Build and install the libdispatch library:

 Please note that the complete instructions for building and installing this library are found [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/blob/master/INSTALL). Though, all you need to do is just this: `cd swift-corelibs-libdispatch && git submodule init && git submodule update && sh ./autogen.sh && ./configure --with-swift-toolchain=<path-to-swift>/usr --prefix=<path-to-swift>/usr && make && make install`

5. Compile and install PCRE2:

 Download the [pcre2](http://ftp.exim.org/pub/pcre/pcre2-10.20.tar.gz) source code. Unpack the tar. Run `./configure && make && sudo make install`. This will place the necessary headers and libraries into /usr/local/include and /user/local/libs.

6. Build Kitura and Kitura Sample

 On the root folder of the Kitura repo, run `make` to build the helper libraries, Kitura framework, and the sample program (invokes swift build).

7. Set the dynamic library loading path:

 In order to run the sample, first you need to point to the shared libraries that have been built by running `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

8. Run the sample program:

 `<path_to_kitura_repo>./.build/debug/KituraSample`. You should see a message that says "Listening on port 8090".

## Usage
Let's write our first Kitura-based Web Application written in Swift!

1) First we need to create a new project directory

```bash
mkdir myFirstProject
```

2) Next we need to go in an initialize this project as a new Swift package project

```bash
cd myFirstProject
swift build --init
```

Now your directory structure under myFirstProject should look like this:
<pre>
myFirstProject
├── Package.swift
├── Sources
│   └── main.swift
└── Tests
    └── <i>empty</i>
</pre>

Note: For more information on the Swift Package Manager, go [here](https://swift.org/package-manager)

3) Now we need to add Kitura as a dependency for your project (Package.swift):

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "myFirstProject",

    dependencies: [
 		.Package(url: "https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-router.git", majorVersion: 0),
	]

)
```

4) Now we can issue a `swift build` command to to download the dependencies.

 Because Swift Package Manager does not compile C code, expect this step to fail because of a linker error.

```bash
swift build
```

5) Copy the Makefile.client from KituraNet to your project as Makefile:

```bash
cp Packages/Kitura-net-0.3.0/Makefile-client Makefile
```

6) Import the modules in your code:

```swift
import KituraRouter
import KituraNet
import KituraSys
```
7) Add a router and a path:

```swift
let router = Router()

router.get("/") {
	request, response, next in

	response.status(HttpStatusCode.OK).send("Hello, World!")

	next()
}
```

8) Create and start a HTTPServer:

```swift
let server = HttpServer.listen(8090, delegate: router)
Server.run()
```

9) Sources/main.swift file should now look like this:

```swift
import KituraRouter
import KituraNet
import KituraSys

let router = Router()

router.get("/") {
request, response, next in

	response.status(HttpStatusCode.OK).send("Hello, World!")

	next()
}

let server = HttpServer.listen(8090, delegate: router)
Server.run()
```

10) Run make

```
make
```

11) Now run your new web application

```
.build/debug/myFirstProject
```

12) Open your browser at [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)
